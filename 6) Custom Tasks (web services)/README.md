### MicroStrategy Tasks (Web Services)

A task in MicroStrategy is nothing more than an HTTP wrapper for the Web SDK. Since other programming languages can execute HTTP requests, this allows all other applications running outside of a JRE to take full advantage of MicroStrategy.

This section will contain a number of tasks created for customer POCs or tasks I have created for my own use.
