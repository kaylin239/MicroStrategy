### Web SDK (Java)

The Web SDK is a very robust set of APIs which the MicroStrategy Web application is built upon. Just about anything you can perform manually through the web interface can be somehow scripted or replicated using the Wek SDK. This section of samples will contain various examples of standalone code that have been created for POCs to solve real business problems.
