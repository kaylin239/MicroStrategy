# Purpose

This is a very simple sample to show how to instantiate a `WebIServerSession` object using the Web SDK. Once a session is created, developers may use the web SDK to peform additional tasks as needed. 


# Dependencies
The Web SDK consists of a number of java packages that are included in the installation/deployment of the MicroStrategy Web application. You can also download a copy of the MSDL which contains all the libraries at the link below:

Using Eclipse (or your preferred java IDE), import the MSTR packages to begin using the Web SDK.
