# JS Embedding API

The JS embedding API is a new API introduced in `version 10.9` which allows developers to easily embed MicroStrategy dossiers and dashboards into 3rd party applications in a responsive manner. It also provides resources to add functionality such as controlling navigation, retrieving and applying filters, setting properties, and managing events, and supports several different authentication environments.
